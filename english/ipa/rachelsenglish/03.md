In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to learn how to
pronounce the EH as in BED vowel.

To make this sound, the jaw drops, eh, and the tongue remains forward with the
tip touching lightly behind the bottom front teeth. Eh.

The mid/front part of the tongue lifts a little bit towards the roof of the
mouth while the back of the tongue feels like it stretches wide.

Eh. In a stressed syllable, the voice has a little curve up, then curve down.
Eh, eh. It’s stressed in the word ‘said’. Let’s watch up close and in slow
motion.

The jaw drops. The tongue tip touches the back of the bottom front teeth, and
the middle part arches up towards the roof of the mouth.

Said, eh, said. In an unstressed syllable, the vowel is lower and flatter in
pitch, as well as quieter and quicker, eh, eh. The vowel is unstressed in the
word ‘employ’, eh. Let’s take a look up close and in slow motion.

Relaxed jaw drop. The middle part of the tongue arches up towards the roof of
the mouth. Here we compare the stressed EH from ‘said’, on top, with the
unstressed version from ‘employ’ on the bottom. Notice the jaw drops more for
the stressed version of this vowel. Because the unstressed version of the vowel
is shorter, there isn’t enough time to make the full jaw drop.

EH stressed: said, EH
EH unstressed: employ, eh
EH, eh. EH, eh.

Example words. Repeat with me:
Red, never, embrace, enter, embody, desk.

I hope this video helps you understand this sound. That’s it, and thanks so
much for using Rachel’s English.
