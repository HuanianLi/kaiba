The ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. The first sound of this diphthong does not
appear on its own as a vowel in American English. To make this sound, aa, ow,
the back part of the tongue stretches a bit towards the soft palate, aa,
and you can see the corners of the lips pull a bit and the top lip pulls
up, showing a little bit more of the top teeth, aa, aa. The second half
of the diphthong is the ‘uh’ as in ‘pull’ vowel sound. In this vowel
sound, the back of the tongue will stretch even further up towards the
soft palate, ow, ow. And you can see the lips will come in and round for
the second part of the diphthong, ow, now.


Here we see both sounds of the diphthong. In the first sound, you can see the
jaw is dropped more. Here are the two sounds in profile. Here parts of the
mouth are drawn in. In the first sound on the left, the tongue is raised and
pulls back, slightly higher in the back. In the second sound the tongue
stretches up towards the soft palate. The tip of the tongue is touching the
bottom front teeth in the first sound, but is not quite touching in the second
sound. The ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. Sample words: cow, bow, sound. Sample
sentence: I found my flowers dead and brown when I came back to town. Now you
will see this sentence up close and in slow motion, both straight on and from
an angle, so you can really study how the mouth moves when making this sound.

I, with the ‘ai’ as in ‘buy’ diphthong. Lip up to make the F in found, and here
we have the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. The space in the mouth gets darker as
the tongue is moving back. My flowers, again, the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’, and again,
you can see the tongue moves back as the space in the mouth gets darker.
Teeth come together for the Z in flowers, also for the D in dead with the
‘eh’ as in ‘bed’ vowel sound. Tongue tip up for the D. And brown, lips
together for the B and again the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. Tongue up to
make the N. The lips form the tight circle for the W, when, tongue tip up
for the N. I came, lips together for the M sound. Back, the tongue up in
the back to make the K sound. To town, with the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong,
lips rounding at the end, tongue tip up for the N.

And now from the angle. I found, the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. You can
see the tongue moving back as the lips come forward and round. My flowers,
again, the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’. The lips come in to round for the second half
of the diphthong. Teeth make the Z position.Dead, tongue tip up for the D.
And brown, again, the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. The tongue there coming
forward from being back for the R. When with the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’, tongue
up for the N. When I came, lips together for the M. Back, you can see the
tongue moving up in the back for the K sound. To with the schwa, town.
Again the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong, see the tongue moving back and the
lips rounding. Tongue tip up for the N. That’s it, and thanks so much for
using Rachel’s English.
