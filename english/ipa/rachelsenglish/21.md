The P and B consonants. These two sounds are paired together because they take
the same mouth position.  P is unvoiced, pp, meaning only air passes through
your mouth.  And B is voiced, bb, meaning, uh, uh, bb, you’re making a sound
with your vocal cords.  To make this sound, the lips will stay together while
the teeth part a little bit, pp, bb.  These are stop consonants.  In stop
consonants, there are two parts.  There is a stop of the airflow, and a
release.  So the stop of the airflow happens, pp, as the lips remain closed,
and the release when they part and the air comes through.  Let’s look
at the nature of a stop consonant in the sample word nap.  Na–, the
lips are together, cutting off the airflow, nap, pp, and they part, the
air is released.  Stop consonants at the ends of words or syllables are
sometimes not released.  In other words, there’s just the first part,
the stop of air flow.  Let’s take for example the sentence I’m going up
later.  I’m going up later.  So the lips came together to make the P —
I’m going up later — but when they opened and the sound continued, it
simply went into the L consonant sound, which was next, without the
release.  I’m going up, I’m going up, I’m going up later.

Here is the sound from the front, where the lips are together but the
teeth are slightly parted. That is why it doesn’t look relaxed. And
here from the side. Again, you can see this tension in the chin as the
teeth are slightly parted even though the lips are closed. Here, parts
of the mouth are drawn in. The soft palate is raised in this sound, and
the tongue itself raises just a little bit, but the tip of the tongue
is still touching the bottom front teeth. Sample words: pad, bad, pot,
bought. Sample sentence: Pick a big print for the bedspread. Now you
will see this sample sentence up close and in slow motion both straight
on and from an angle, so you can really study how the mouth moves when
making this sound.

Pick, the lips press together as the jaw drops slightly. A big, again,
the lips press together as the jaw drops. Print, again the P sound.
Tongue goes up to make the T. Lip comes up to make the F in ‘for’. The,
lips together, bb, bedspread, and here again to make the P in spread.
Jaw drops to make the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’ vowel sound, and the tip of the
tongue up to make the D. And here from an angle. The lips press
together even as the jaw drops and the teeth part. Pick, the ‘ih’ as in
‘sit’ sound. Pick a big, again the lips come together for the B, big.
And again for the P, print. Tongue up for the T. For the. Lips together
for the B in bed-, and again for the p in -spread. The ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’
and the tongue up to make that D. That’s it, and thanks so much for
using Rachel’s English.
