## [English: How to Pronounce the Schwa [ə]](https://rachelsenglish.com/english-pronounce-schwa/)

English has eleven different vowels. It’s important to know the correct mouth
position so you can get the vowel right:  study this vowel with illustrations
and up close, slow motion speech.  Sample words:  Allow, extra, data, again,
visa, about.

In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to learn how to
pronounce the schwa vowel sound.

This vowel is always unstressed. The mouth position is a lot like the UH as in
BUTTER vowel, but that vowel can be and usually is stressed. But just like that
vowel, everything in your lips, jaw, and neck should be relaxed for this sound.

Just slightly drop your jaw to make this sound. The trick is to keep everything
else relaxed.

Let’s look at the vowel up close and in slow motion.

It’s possible to make this sound on its own with just the slightest jaw drop.
But in actual words, you will likely see a bit more jaw drop, like here, on the
word ‘sofa’. Lips relaxed, cheeks relaxed, tongue forward and relaxed.

As I said, this vowel can only be in an unstressed syllable. All other vowel
and diphthong sounds can either be stressed or unstressed. So the schwa will
always be really fast and low in pitch. Uh, uh. Sofa, uh. Ability, uh.

The schwa goes with the syllabic consonants L, M, N, and R. That means when you
have a syllable with a schwa followed by one of these consonants, you don’t
need to make the schwa. It gets absorbed by the next sound. For example, the
word ‘father’: th-rr, th-rr. Just go from the TH sound right into the R sound
without trying to make a separate schwa. Father, -ther.

The schwa: always unstressed. Uh, sofa, uh, uh, ability, uh.

Example words. Repeat with me:
Allow, extra, data, again, visa, about.

I hope this video helps you understand this sound. That’s it, and thanks so
much for using Rachel’s English.
